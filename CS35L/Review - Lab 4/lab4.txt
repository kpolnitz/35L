First we start off by getting the coreutils bug onto the computer:
We make a temp folder to put it in:

mkdir oldcore
cd oldcore
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall17/
cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

Then we unzip and place its contents in the folder:

tar -xzf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz 

Then we navigate to coreutils and try to build it.

./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classkae/Desktop/Lab4/
oldcore/coreutils-with-bug
make
make install

We run into a problem:

utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^
It seems that this error is a result of having duplicate types
of futimens, the patch deals with this by only using one of them.

In fixing this issue, we patch this in coreutils:

touch corepatch
vi corepatch <— we copy and paste patch here
patch -p1 < corepatch

Then we try to build it again and it builds successfully.
We can test this by duplicating what’s on Assignment 4:

We must make sure to use the following:
TZ=UTC0 ~/Desktop/Lab4/oldcore/coreutils-with-bug/bin/ls -lt 
--full-time wwi-armistice now now1
Otherwise, we will not use the correct ls command and get the wrong result.

In doing so, we run into a bug:

-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 2017-10-30 02:05:53.327530210 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 2017-10-30 02:05:37.068260907 +0000 now

We start the flawed ls in gdb by utilizing:

gdb ls 

After receiving the executable ls for debugging. 

(This was inside the source folder)

We want to analyze the relationships with time. We can look for the functions revolving around time. I did info to see how I could go about doing this. I started by looking at:
info variables
I became interested in the static long current_time and current_time_ns variables. I kept these variables in the back of my mind.
Next,  I went through the program with list. I kept using this command until I came along lines of code that dealt with time:
sort_files() - 1259: Could have something to do with the order. We run along a switch case
having to do with the ls -t command:

1582		case 't':
1583		  sort_type = sort_time;
1584		  sort_type_specified = true;
(gdb) 
1585		  break;

This told me to look for the variable sort_time. I believe that is where the error is.
The list process became tedious, so I began looking at the functions (info functions). We see the
following functions dealing with time:

static int compare_atime(V, V);
static int compare_ctime(V, V);
static int compare_mtime(V, V);
static int compstr_atime(V, V);
static int compstr_ctime(V, V);
static int compstr_mtime(V, V);
static void sort_files(void);
(Just to start)

What we will do is place breakpoints at the beginning of different functions and check variables to see if they are acting correctly.

After inserting breakpoints and testing the functionality with the command (b [insert function] for the first 4 functions), we notice a more interesting breakpoint noted in this output from info b:

Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
2       breakpoint     keep y   <MULTIPLE>         
2.1                         y     0x0000000000406483 in rev_cmp_mtime 
                                                   at ../lib/timespec.h:48
2.2                         y     0x00000000004064c0 in compare_mtime 
                                                   at ../lib/timespec.h:48
(this says two because I deleted a breakpoint beforehand. It says breakpoint 1 at the bottom because I restarted gdb).

At first I naively tried to test out the breakpoint by doing:

r -lt --full-time  ~/Desktop/Lab4/oldcore/coreutils-with-bug/bin/wwi-armistice

Instead we ran: 

/w/home.07/class/classkae/Desktop/Lab4/oldcore/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time  ~/Desktop/Lab4/oldcore/coreutils-with-bug/bin/wwi-armistice  ~/Desktop/Lab4/oldcore/coreutils-with-bug/bin/1st

When we ran the ls -lt command with this breakpoint we got:

Breakpoint 1, compare_mtime (a=0x6170b0, b=0x617160) at ls.c:2884
2884	static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll); }

This told me that I should check out the code around line 2884 (list 2884).

2880	  int diff = timespec_cmp (get_stat_mtime (&b->stat),
2881				   get_stat_mtime (&a->stat));
2882	  return diff ? diff : cmp (a->name, b->name);
2883	}
2884	static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll); }
2885	static int compstr_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, strcmp); }
2886	static int rev_cmp_mtime (V a, V b) { return compare_mtime (b, a); }
2887	static int rev_str_mtime (V a, V b) { return compstr_mtime (b, a); }
2888

We see that compare_mtime is somehow control by cmp_mtime, but I will step through the processes to see if 
we can spot the problem with the code given (s).

I notice that this is responsible for getting the time:
2880	  int diff = timespec_cmp (get_stat_mtime (&b->stat),
2881				   get_stat_mtime (&a->stat));

This told me that I should check out that function:

timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:48
48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;

In stepping, we discover that this function leads to timespec.h, which I checked out in vim.
In the function we notice a variable called diff. I start to look at the values of diff after stepping.

$3 = 3
to 
$4 = 1509039365
after 
return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
This indicates some radical changes during 
int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec

I see this comment before:
/* Return negative, zero, positive if A < B, A == B, A > B, respectively.
   Assume the nanosecond components are in range, or close to it.  */

This gives me the impression that the subtraction between the recent year (2017) and the old year (1918) 
confused the system because of the large difference (possible overflow?).

The comment hints at how we should fix the timespec problem. Because want to make a diff file, we will make a duplicate
for comparison later. (Different window)
cp timespec.h othertimespec.h

Here is the piece of code inserted into the duplicate:

    if (a.tv_sec > b.tv_sec)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    else if (a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec)
    {
        return -1;
    }
  return 0;


Basically coding what the command gave.
Then, I was finally able to make the diff file (patch) in the “form of a ChangeLog entry”
I looked online and found out that the feature is within emacs.
I used C-x 4 a and added my own commentary for my patch.

Let’s now try the same issue on the SEASnet server:

-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 2054-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000 anotheroldfile
-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 2017-10-28 02:49:50.998972000 +0000 oldlol
-rw-r--r-- 1 classkae class 0 2017-10-28 02:49:40.148816000 +0000 newlol

The issue persists on the SEASnet home directory! It handles it poorly!
