Answers to Q1-Q4

A1:The line in question was a duplicate if we look at Brady's code on 
the patch page. It also wasn't necessary to delete because 
commands would fall through to the second line.

A2:It could be a problem internationally as different countries would interpret 
the format differently. Also, military-time/12-hour time could be confusing.

A3: when running python ./randline.py /dev/null/, I received the following:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 72, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 66, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 36, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
    # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This is because there are no numbers/data to work with (it's empty).

A4: We can do:

/usr/local/cs/bin/python3 ./randline.py /dev/null on lnxsrv09

  File "./randline.py", line 67
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

We get a syntax error; there are subtle syntax differences
between python 2 and python 3.
