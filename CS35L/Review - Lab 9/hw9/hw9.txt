1. hw9.txt will keep a log of all of the steps we take in the homework.
2. First, we will checkout version 3.0 of diffutils under a branch named "quote"

git checkout v3.0 -b quote 

3. Then I run my patch:

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. Next I learned how to use the command add-change-log-entry-other-window

5. I changed my log for the patch, similar to the way it was framed 
in the original patch. I gave separate descriptions for each of the files 
changed.

6. Then I committed the changes that I made:

git add (to put it in the stage for commit) 
git commit (to commit the changes).


7. Next I used git format-patch to generate formatted-patch.txt
To use this, we needed my hex pattern: (d73ce7feb5e0e47ea453e20955d7e90bd37b4936)


I then did: 

git format-patch -1 --stdout d73ce7feb5e0e47ea453e20955d7e90bd37b4936  > formatted-patch.txt

8. For my partner I created a new branch 

git checkout v3.0 -b partner

I applied their patch with 

git am < format2.txt (partner's).

9.

Everything was built and ran successfully (make distdir, etc.) and gave the 
same output as anticipated. 

10.

Next, we are going to run gitk on the git repository in Eggert's folder.
I used the following to login/use XQuartz (for some reason -X didn't work 
properly):

ssh -Y classkae@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

I was having problems accessing gitk so I had to do the following:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cs/bin

After doing everything above, I proceeding to take the required snapshot
and give its description.
