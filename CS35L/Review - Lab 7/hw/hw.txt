1. To answer to the beginning of the question, yes it can be secure. Even
though a person might have been able to observe the public key, 
it would still be fairly difficult. The text is deciphered with a private
key, which is only accessible locally on the end of the remote server 
(the server asking for the password).
1)
In this situation, it would be insecure because they could send 
the exact text that would be decrypted. Essentially, it would
be as if they typed in the same keystrokes to begin with.

2)
This connection would also be insecure because having access to the other 
end of the USB would give them the power of being the root user. As a
result, they could obtain all of your keys, IP addresses, set passwords, etc.

 
2. --verify isn't efficient in checking for that tar file because it only
checks the modification of the tar file (signature). It does not give
us access to who created and sent the files. In fixing this problem,
we can introduce an outside party that can check the signatures for 
us. They can look at the movement of the file (who sent the file, who created
the file, etc.)
